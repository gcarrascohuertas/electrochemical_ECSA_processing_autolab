# Electrochemical ECSA fit tools in Python

# Overview

Electrochemical surface area is one of the most important  parameters in electrochemistry. Unfortunately, experimental research of this material property is complicated due to  processing data time involved. 

This project aims to provide quick-tools developed in Python for ECSA data treatment. 
Main tools consist in obtain following parameters: 

- Area (cm2) for anodic analysis.
- Area (cm2) for cathodic analysis.
- Stacked plots associated to ECSA analysis.
- Randles–Ševčík plots associated to ECSA analysis for cathodic and anodic peaks.

# Python modules required for running script

Prior to run the ECSA script, install following python packages 

Matplotlib

    python -m pip install -U pip
    python -m pip install -U matplotlib

Numpy

    pip install numpy
    
Pandas

    pip install pandas
    
Glob

    pip install glob3
    
Shutil  

    pip install pytest-shutil   
    
Astropy 

    pip install astropy
    
    
# Additional coments

The Electrochemical ECSA fit tools in the Python version are still in it's beta state. This means that it can have some bugs and issues. However, testing and contributing is very welcome.
