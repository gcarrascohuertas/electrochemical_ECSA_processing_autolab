# About

Here I provided a short-guide of experimental acquisition data. I summarized the main things you need to take into account but [gcarrascohuertas]( https://github.com/gcarrascohuertas) is not responsible for the bad use of this guide and its consequences over materials and people involved. Please, be careful and document all steps you perform. 

# Electrochemical setup

First you need following materials in order to perform experiments:

- Three-electrode cell

    - Platinum mesh as counter electrode (CE)). Here I used  a [Planium mesh from Goodfellow](http://www.goodfellow.com/A/Platinum-Mesh.html)
    - Ag/AgCl as reference electrode (RE). Here I used  a [Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M)](https://www.basinc.com/products/MF-2056)
    - Your working electrode (WE). Here I used a a polished  [Glassy carbon electrode](https://www.basinc.com/products/MF-2012)   (GC, 3 mm diameter, BASI).

- Electrolyte
    - K<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]  0.004 M (0.000004 mol/cm<sup>3</sup>) dissolved in 0.1 M KCl (D = 7.6Eâˆ’6 cm<sup>2</sup>/s)
   
# Electrochemical technique

Electrochemical techniques performed is cyclic voltammograms with a staircase profile (CV). Parameters: 

   - Start potential : 0.69 V.
   - Upper vertex potential: 0.7 V.
   - Lower vertex potential: -0.1 V.
   - Stop potential: 0.69 V. 
   - Number of scans: 4.
   - Step: 0.002 V.
   - Scan rates: 5 mV/seg , 10 mV/seg , 20 mV/seg , 40 mV/seg , 60 mV/seg ,80 mV/seg , 100 mV/seg , 125 mV/seg , 150 mV/seg , 200 mV/seg.
   
# Electrochemical measurements

# Experimental NOVA software routine 

Once you finish setting-up all the electrochemical cell components. Create experimental sequence with the parameteres displayed in the  screenshots attached in this project.  

WARNING: Due to PStrace (PalmSens) software is licensed I can not upload sequence (.psmethod file). If you want PStrace (PalmSens) software sequence for ECSA measurements (.psmethod files) do no hesitate to contact me at :  gasparcarrascohuertas@gmail.com
